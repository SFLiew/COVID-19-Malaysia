Correlation of COVID-19â€™s fatality case and vaccination coverage in Malaysia


OVERVIEW:

Covid-19 epidemic has been around the world since 2020. Many measurements are implemented to curb the infection, such as wearing face mask, keeping safety distance with others, and the most prioritized step taken by government is enforcing the vaccination. According to Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin in March 2022, "two million people who received the Sinovac vaccine as their primary vaccination will lose their fully-vaccinated status (if they do not get their booster jab based on the deadline fixed by the ministry) on April 1". It seems vaccination is going to be a long haul requirement until the next more effective containment tool is available.

Is vaccination really effective in containing the infection of Covid-19? hereby would like to analyze the death case against vaccination coverage in Malaysia. There are 2 main parts in this analysis project:

A) An overview understanding of the death case by distribution in age group, gender, state and vaccination status
B) Correlation between death case and vaccination coverage


DATA SOURCE:
1. Death case and vaccination data are retrieved from open data available in the official Github account of Malaysia's Ministry of Health. https://github.com/MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public
--> linelist_deaths: daily updated new deaths, data available since 15 February 2020 to date
--> vax_state: daily updated vaccination at district level, data available since 24 February 2021 to date

2. Lat-lon data is retrived from simplemaps website: https://simplemaps.com/data/my-cities
