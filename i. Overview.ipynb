    "Covid-19 epidemic has been around the world since 2020.  Many measurements are implemented to curb the infection, such as wearing face mask, keeping safety distance with others, and the most prioritized step taken by government is enforcing the vaccination.  According to Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin in March 2022, \"two million people who received the Sinovac vaccine as their primary vaccination will lose their fully-vaccinated status (if they do not get their booster jab based on the deadline fixed by the ministry) on April 1\".  It seems vaccination is going to be a long haul requirement until the next more effective containment tool is available.  \n",

According to the fatality rate distribution analysis, elderly men should take extra caution to prevent getting infected to this disease.  Based on the analysis results of the correlation between vaccine coverage and daily new deaths, it proved that the mass vaccination policy could ease the infection rate and thus decrease in death case numbers.
